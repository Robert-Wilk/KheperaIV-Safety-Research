# KheperaIV-Safety-Research
CBF, SBC, and PrSBC research on Khepera IV robots using CoppeliaSim


This code utilizes the KheperaIV which is not native to CoppeliaSim. To add the KheperaIV robot to CoppeliaSim head to [this Github repo](https://github.com/EAPH/K4_Model_VREP), download the files, and import into CoppeliaSim. To learn more about the KheperaIV robot model in CoppeliaSim check out [Farias et al.'s research paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.1721).


This code also utilizes snippets from the [Robotarium Python Simulator](https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium_python_simulator).
